  Hi there 👋 I'm Alexei
</h1>
<p align='center'>
  👀  I'm interested in Data Analysis, Data engineering and Product Analysis.
</p>
<p align='center'>
  💪  In this account I will upload my pet-projects, some information about myself and my education (courses, excersises etc.).
</p>
<p align='center'>
  🙋‍♂️  I’m looking to collaborate on simple/beginner-friendly Data Analysis/Product Analysis/Data Sciense/ML projects with Python implementation.
